From the downloaded folder, traverse to the Code Files for Assignment 4 (Mini Project 2)
subfolder
To find plot accuracy v/s iterations graph for both dataset using random sampling and
uncertainty sampling fire command,
 
>> run(iteration)
where,  iteration  is number of iterations we want to run the algorithm
find the graph plotted on a figure and time taken to compute the value printed in the command window.
